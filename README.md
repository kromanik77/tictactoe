# tictactoe

This is a tic-tac-toe evaluation program written in Python. The program evaluates an N X N tic-tac-toe board to see if there is a winner. If so, it prints whether it found a row, column or diagonal match and it prints the winning value.

Notes:
1. It assumes the tic-tac-toe board is given as a list of lists, where the first element of the top level list is the first row of the board.
2. It doesn't read input. The top level function is called "check", which takes a board as input.
3. It makes sure the given board is N X N and exits with an error if not.
4. It makes no assumptions about how many different values are on the board or if they are strings or numbers (easy to do in Python).
